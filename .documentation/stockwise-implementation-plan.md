# OmniStock Implementation Approach

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (2-3 weeks)
1. **Core Architecture Setup**
   - Set up project structure (React + TypeScript frontend, chosen backend framework)
   - Configure development environment with containerization
   - Implement basic CI/CD pipeline

2. **Authentication System**
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Set up JWT authentication
   - Create basic user management

3. **Database Foundation**
   - Set up database with initial schema for Products, Variants, and Inventory
   - Create database migration strategy

## Phase 2: MVP Core Features (4-5 weeks)
1. **Product Management**
   - Build product CRUD operations
   - Implement basic product listing and filtering
   - Create CSV import functionality

2. **Basic Inventory Management**
   - Develop inventory tracking system
   - Implement manual inventory adjustments
   - Create inventory history tracking

3. **Simple Dashboard**
   - Build clean, minimal dashboard showing key metrics
   - Implement basic stock level indicators
   - Create simple navigation structure

## Phase 3: Integration Framework (3-4 weeks)
1. **Platform Connection Framework**
   - Develop secure credential storage system
   - Create platform connection wizard for one platform first (Shopify recommended)
   - Implement connection status monitoring

2. **Synchronization System**
   - Build basic synchronization job scheduler
   - Implement inventory pull operations
   - Create error handling for failed synchronizations

3. **Webhook Listeners**
   - Set up webhook endpoints for real-time updates
   - Implement order event handling
   - Create basic notification system for sync issues

## Phase 4: Expanding Features (4-5 weeks)
1. **Additional Platform Integrations**
   - Add Amazon integration
   - Add eBay integration
   - Implement platform-specific settings

2. **Enhanced Inventory Features**
   - Build low stock alerts system
   - Implement variant management
   - Create batch inventory operations

3. **Reporting System**
   - Develop basic inventory reports
   - Create sales data visualization
   - Implement CSV export functionality

## Phase 5: Polishing & Optimization (2-3 weeks)
1. **UI/UX Refinement**
   - Optimize responsive design
   - Implement loading state indicators
   - Enhance error handling and user feedback

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement client-side caching
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Conduct comprehensive testing
   - Set up production environment
   - Deploy MVP for early access users

## Recommended Starting Point

For the initial implementation, focus on these core features:

1. **Product Catalog Management**: This is foundational - build a solid product database first
2. **Basic Inventory Tracking**: Get the core inventory adjustment functionality working
3. **First Platform Integration**: Choose one platform (Shopify recommended as it has good API documentation) to prove the integration concept
4. **Simple Dashboard**: Provide immediate value with a clean dashboard showing inventory status

This approach prioritizes building the core value proposition (centralized inventory) before expanding to multiple platforms. It enables you to get user feedback early while establishing the technical foundation for more complex features.
